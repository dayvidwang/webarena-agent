# Gold Trajectory Generation

This document is intended to help me generate gold trajectories for my project. 

## Agent Trajectory

At each step in the agent trajectory, I will be able to view the web browser and the HTML/accessibility tree output. This allows me to issue a natural language command with some rationale so that the agent can generate its own action. 

## Verification Process

If the action generated by the agent is correct (as verified by me), then the agent will execute that action and append it to the gold trajectory. It is important to verify that the accessibility tree tags are accurate and reproducible for the partial gold experiment.

## Conclusion

By following this process, I can generate reliable and reusable gold trajectories for my project.
